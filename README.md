## Background
This challenge focuses on residential and non-residential property sale prices (Prices Paid) within Greater Manchester, UK. 
The dataset is a modified, falsified version of the UK Prices Paid data and includes falsified risk information. Do not use it for real-world decisions or analysis.

Scope and timeframe:
- Geographic focus: Greater Manchester only.
- Time period: 01/1996 to 12/2024.

The data is provided in the [data](data) folder as parquet files. This is real world data, there may be missing values and/or errors.

## The Challenge Questions
Some questions are intentionally ambiguous; justify your choices and methodology.

1. What are the top 10 most expensive detached homes sold as Freehold in Manchester City after 2010?
2. What are the top 5 most expensive postal sectors (postal sectors are the section of the postal code after the area sector: examples include `M1 3`, `M1 4`) in the Salford district between March 2012 and September 2015?
3. Where do you think in Greater Manchester are the most residential homes being built over the past 10 years?
4. What was the most expensive non-residential property sold in Greater Manchester in 2017? Find and share context about this sale.
